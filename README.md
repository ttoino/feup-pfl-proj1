# FEUP-PFL-PROJ1

First project for the PFL course unit at FEUP.

The goal of this project was to develop a representation of mathematical **Polynomials** and implement functions that could manipulate them, namely:

- addition and subtraction
- multiplication
- differentiation
- normalization

Besides these, the designed structures should be parsable to and from an adequate textual representation.
